**California Housing Price Prediction with Linear Regression **

** Project Overview**

This project explores the use of linear regression for predicting California housing prices. It leverages the popular sklearn library and visualizes insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

Key Functionalities:

Data exploration and visualization
Preprocessing with feature scaling
Train-test split
Model selection and training (Linear Regression)
Evaluation metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
Cross-validation for robustness
Prediction visualization
(Optional) Feature importance analysis
️ Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn
Use code with caution.

** Usage**

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory: cd california-housing-prediction
Run the script: python california_housing_prediction.py
** Structure**

This repository includes the following files:

california_housing_prediction.py: The main Python script containing all the code.
README.md: This file (you're reading it now!).
** Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

We'll dive deep into the California housing dataset to understand its features and relationships. Data cleaning and feature scaling will be applied for optimal model performance.

** Model Training and Evaluation**

Linear regression will be trained to learn the underlying patterns between features and housing prices. We'll evaluate its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

** Cross-Validation**

To ensure the model'sgeneralizability on unseen data, we'll perform cross-validation. This technique involves splitting the data into multiple folds, training on some folds, and evaluating on others.

** Visualization**

We'll create insightful visualizations to explore data distributions, correlations, and the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.

** Feature Importance (Optional)**

This section delves into which features contribute the most to the model's predictions (optional). This analysis helps understand the model's inner workings and identify potentially influential factors.
