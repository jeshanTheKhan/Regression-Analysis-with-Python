# Project Title 

Regression Analysis with Python


## Introduction

This repository contains code for a California housing price prediction model using linear regression. The model explores data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Key Functionalities

- Loads the California housing dataset using `fetch_california_housing` from scikit-learn.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's distribution and relationships.
- Preprocesses the data by scaling features using `StandardScaler`.
- Splits data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Trains a linear regression model using `LinearRegression`.
- Evaluates model performance using mean squared error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
- Performs cross-validation for more robust evaluation with `cross_val_score`.
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted values to assess model predictions.
- (Optional) Analyzes feature importance to identify the most impactful features.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python california_housing_prediction.py
   ```

## Explanation

The provided code demonstrates the following steps commonly used in building machine learning models:

1. ## Data Loading and Exploration: 
   - `fetch_california_housing` loads the CA housing dataset.
   - `pd.DataFrame` creates a pandas DataFrame for easier data manipulation.
   - `head()` and `describe()` provide basic insights into the data.
   - `sns.heatmap` creates a heatmap visualizing feature correlations.

2. ## Data Preprocessing:
   - `df.drop` removes the target variable for feature scaling.
   - `StandardScaler` scales features to a standard normal distribution.

3. ## Train-Test Split:
   - `train_test_split` divides data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

4. ## Model Selection and Training:
   - `LinearRegression` creates a linear regression model.
   - `model.fit` trains the model on the training data.

5. ## Prediction and Evaluation:
   - `model.predict` generates predictions on the testing set.
   - `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score` calculate performance metrics.

6. ## Cross-Validation:
   - `cross_val_score` performs cross-validation to assess model generalizability.

7. ## Visualization:
   - `plt.scatter` plots actual vs. predicted values.

8. ## (Optional) Feature Importance:## 
   - Analyze feature coefficients to identify which features influence predictions the most.

## Additional Notes

- Consider using a validation set for fine-tuning hyperparameters and improving model performance.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms depending on the problem and data characteristics.
